# unit-4-game
A short mini game created during the fourth week of my Bootcamp

Goal: Defeat all your enemies. All their HP hits 0 while your fighter stays alive.

Intructions:
1. Select your fighter (click on any of the available 4 different characters)
2. Select the enemy you want to fight (click on any of the available enemies on the bottom row)
3. Fight! (click the fight button)
    NOTE: Damage is calculated randomly, but you should have the ability to win; some luck is required :)
4. Continue to fight! (After you defeat an enemy, continue to click on the next one or pick a different one until there are none left)
5. ???
6. Profit! (JK, either you win or lose the game, click Try Again to play again)
